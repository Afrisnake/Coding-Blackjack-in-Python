# Coding-Blackjack-in-Python
Python code for a multi-player game of Blackjack

## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook includes the Python code for a simple, textual, multi-player, multi-deck game of Blackjack - the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Each player competes against the dealer with the aim of reaching a hand total closer to 21 (but not exceeding this value) than the dealer's total. The [Wikipedia entry for Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) provides full details. The code was developed as a milestone project for the [2021 Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/).

## Implementation
My implementation is a simplified version of the game, not including functions to **double down**, **split**, **surrender** or place **insurance bets**.
- The computer acts as the dealer
- Any number of players can compete
- Any number of decks can be used for a given game
- Any number of rounds can be played in a game, until all players have a zero bank balance
- For each round, players can assign a value (1 or 11) to each ace card in their hand

## Dependencies
Python 3.8
